#' @param timescale \code{character}. The name of the desired timescale to return a definition for (e.g., "international epochs").
#' @param interval_name \code{character}. The name of the desired interval to return a definition for. If set to NULL (default), all interval data for the respective timescale is returned.
#' @param interval_id \code{integer}. The identification number(s) of the desired time interval to return a definition for.
#' @param age \code{numeric}. Age in millions of years before present to return an interval definition for. All intervals overlapping with this age will be returned.
#' @param age_top \code{numeric}. The minimum age for which interval definitions should be returned, in millions of years before present. If specified, `age_bottom` must also be specified, and this must be younger than `age_bottom`.
#' @param age_bottom \code{numeric}. The maximum age for which interval definitions should be returned, in millions of years before present. If specified, `age_top` must also be specified, and this must be older than `age_top`.
#' @param rule \code{character}. How should interval definitions be returned for the given `age_top` and `age_bottom`? Use "contains" to return all intervals that fall entirely within `age_top` and `age_bottom`. Use "exact" to return any intervals with both boundaries equal to `age_top` and `age_bottom`. Use "loose" (the default) to return all intervals touching the range of `age_top` and `age_bottom`. If `age_top` and `age_bottom` are not provided, this argument is ignored.
#' @param true_colors \code{logical}. Should the original international time scale colors be returned? Defaults to `TRUE`.
